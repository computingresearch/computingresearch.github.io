# About
The Computing Research Leadership Council (CRLC) was formed in 2016 to identify and address current and future issues of common interest to the computing organizations in the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) labs and to represent these issues to relevant stakeholders. These organizations constitute a significant national investment and resource in the mathematics, computer science, and computational science research required to advance the scientific and engineering needs of the DOE Office of Science, the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration, and the nation. The CRLC represents wide areas of scientific computing and adopts the charter of understanding and supporting the DOE’s broad scientific mission in energy, environment, and national security as well as anticipating the future needs in applied mathematics, data science, and computer science.  Issues of common interest include the effective development and management of core expertise, forward-looking research roadmaps, major research initiatives, topical and strategic workshops, inter-laboratory collaborations, etc. 

# Current Composition
The CRLC consists of representatives from eight multipurpose Department of Energy laboratories who either lead the principal computing research divisions or are designees thereof.

The current representatives are:
- Argonne National Laboratory:  [Valerie Taylor](https://www.anl.gov/proﬁle/valerie-e-taylor), Director, Mathematics & Computer Science Division
- Brookhaven National Laboratory: [Adolfy Hoisie](https://www.bnl.gov/staH/ahoisie), (Acting) Deputy ALD, Computing and Data Sciences Directorate
- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: [Stefan Wild](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/about-amcr/staH/director/stefan-wild/), Director, Applied Mathematics & Computational Research (AMCR) Division 
- Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: [Jeffrey Hittinger](https://people.llnl.gov/hittinger1), Director, Center for Applied Scientiﬁc Computing (CASC) Division
- Los Alamos National Laboratory: [Aric Hagberg](https://aric.hagberg.org/), Division Lead, Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division
- Oak Ridge National Laboratory: [Michael Parks](https://www.ornl.gov/staH-proﬁle/michael-l-parks), Director, Computer Science & Mathematics Division
- Pacific Northwest National Laboratory: [James Ang](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/james-ang), PCSD Chief Scientist for Computing
- Sandia National Laboratories: [James Stewart](https://www.sandia.gov/ccr/staH/james-r-stewart/), Senior Manager, Computational Sciences and Math Group

A convener of the CRLC rotates alphabetically through these eight laboratories. The 2024 convener is Stefan Wild and serves as point of contact for the CRLC. 

# Sample Activities

While the key role of the CRLC is to improve communication and coordination among DOE laboratories and their stakeholders, the CRLC also engages in community-building activities.  Past CRLC activities include:

- [CRLC-Sustainable Horizons Seminar Series](https://shinstitute.org/computing-research-leadership-council-crlc-seminar-series/)
- [2019 CRLC Workshop on the Future of Machine Learning and Data Analytics across the Department of Energy](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/mldavisioning)
- [2019 CRLC Workshop on the Future of Uncertainty Quantification and Multiscale Modeling Across the Department of Energy](http://web.archive.org/web/20210413050022/https://www.sandia.gov/mathvisioning/index.html) 
- [2019 CRLC Site visit to Argonne](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/article/argonne-hosts-computational-leadership-research-council-meeting)
- [CRLC 2016 presentation](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/ascr/ascac/pdf/meetings/201604/160405_ASCAC_David_Brown.pdf) to the Department of Energy’s Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC)

Note that the CRLC is not a funding entity.
